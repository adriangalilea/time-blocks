# TimeBlocks
 Visually representing time.

# What options do exist to keep track of time?
I've always been mesmerized by Hourglasses, there's no better time representation than that, you understand it the first time you see it... but can is it precise enough to be practical? I don't think so.

Another fun observation is jail day counting, I can not even find documentation on it, it's just so intuitive that is taken for granted. I had no luck in Google or ChatGPT, like... why does this not have a name if it's so ubiquitous.

Then there's the analog watch/clock abstraction, that takes quite a while to read "intuitively", but once you learn it's very precise.

Then there's the digital abstraction, 11:30, that is easy to understand conceptually once you are taught, and it'll never get easier on a concious level, but you have to read/interpret it, it's not intuitive enough to judge what time is it visually, there's just no cues, it's too complex.

# Ideation
I've always thought that there was space in the middle for something else. Something in between an Hourglass and a digital clock.

I've been exploring this idea for a long time, subsconsciously for the most part, through the last decade.

A conceptual representation of time that could be understood more intuitivly.

With enough precision to be practical.

And intuitive enough that could be understood by your peripheral vision.

Bulova Computron - A watch that could be seen without moving your wrist(but the button had to be pressed wtf).
